# Datacurso AI Provider for Moodle

The **Datacurso AI Provider** is the core engine that connects Moodle with the **Datacurso AI services** — unlocking a full ecosystem of smart, AI-powered plugins designed to revolutionize online learning.

This provider serves as the central bridge that powers every Datacurso AI extension, enabling a new generation of intelligent features for teachers, students, and administrators.

In addition, the **Datacurso AI Provider** includes built-in capabilities to display **detailed AI credit usage reports** directly within Moodle.  
Administrators can easily monitor and manage AI service consumption through visual dashboards showing:

- **Number of credits consumed per month**
- **Available credits**
- **Total credits consumed**
- **Credit distribution by service**
- **Daily credit usage trends**

## Powering Moodle’s Built-In AI Features

Beyond the Datacurso suite, the **AI Provider** also enables Moodle’s **native AI features**, enhancing creativity and productivity across your entire platform:

- **Generate Text** – Create meaningful content from any prompt.  
- **Generate Image** – Produce original images from text descriptions.  
- **Summarize Text** – Quickly generate concise summaries from course content.

## Pre-requisites

1. Tener minimo la version 4.5 de moodle
2. Adquirir un paquete de creditos de AI desde el [shop de DataCurso](https://shop.datacurso.com/index.php?m=tokens_manager) y crear una llave de licencia tal como se indica en la seccion [Obtener llaves de licencia](#obtener-llaves-de-licencia)

## Installing via uploaded ZIP file

1. Log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to `Site administration > Plugins > Install plugins`.
2. Upload the ZIP file with the plugin code. You should only be prompted to add
   extra details if your plugin type is not automatically detected.
3. Check the plugin validation report and finish the installation.

## Installing manually

The plugin can be also installed by putting the contents of this directory to

```
{your/moodle/dirroot}/ai/provider/datacurso
```

Afterwards, log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to `Site administration > Notifications` to complete the installation.

Alternatively, you can run

```bash
php admin/cli/upgrade.php
```

to complete the installation from the command line.

## Testing locally (cURL settings)

If you plan to test from a local environment, adjust Moodle’s cURL security settings so the provider and its dependent plugins can make HTTP requests:

1. In the site administration search box, type "curl" and open the page that shows cURL/HTTP security settings.
2. In the first field `cURL blocked hosts list`, remove any registered IP addresses or host entries.
3. In the second field `cURL allowed ports list`, add the port where your local Moodle is running (for example: `8000`).

These Moodle security settings directly affect the Datacurso AI Provider and, therefore, the functionality of any plugins that depend on it.

    ![Copy License Key](./_docs/images/aiprovider_datacurso_copy_license_key.png)

**Note:** We can create several license keys and assign different amounts of credits to use them in different moodle sites.

## Plugin Configuration

   ![AI Providers](./_docs/images/aiprovider_datacurso_ai_providers.png)

   ![Providers list](./_docs/images/aiprovider_datacurso_5_page-providers.png)

   - **License key**: Enter the license key that we copied in the [Obtain License Keys](#obtain-license-keys) section

   ![Config](./_docs/images/aiprovider_datacurso_5_page-provider-create-form-datacurso.png)

4. Enable instance :

   ![Config](./_docs/images/aiprovider_datacurso_5_page-providers-register.png)

> **⚠️ Important:** Only one instance should be created with this provider for proper use.


## Datacurso AI Provider 

In this section we will find global reports and configurations from our provider.

To view the reports, go to `Site administration > Reports > General report Datacurso AI`.

![Config](./_docs/images/aiprovider_datacurso_5_link_section.png)

## Rate limits and credits per action

Window limits and the estimated credits per action are configured directly on the provider
instance form (`Site administration > General > AI > AI Providers > Datacurso AI Provider`),
next to the license key: one section per service, with an enable/limit/time-window group plus a
credits field for each action the service can trigger. There is no separate configuration page,
no per-user token limits, and no per-service user allowlist: access control is handled entirely
by Moodle permissions, and consumption limits are enforced centrally by the Datacurso service
against the values sent from this form.

## Actions

From the same configuration page of the **Datacurso AI Provider**, you can enable and customize the following Moodle AI-powered actions, seamlessly integrated with Moodle’s native capabilities:

- **Generate Text** – Create meaningful content from any prompt.  
- **Generate Image** – Produce original images from text descriptions.  
- **Summarize Text** – Quickly generate concise summaries from course content.

![Actions](./_docs/images/aiprovider_datacurso_actions.png)

> **Image delivery contract.** The AI service returns generated images inline (`b64_json`). If it returns an image URL instead, the plugin only downloads it over `https` from the same host as the AI service endpoint, with a `png`/`jpg`/`jpeg`/`webp` extension, without following redirects and up to 10 MiB; images hosted on a third-party CDN are rejected by design.

### History Consumption Credits 

Here we can see three sections. The first section shows the credit consumption history for AI usage in plugins that use the Datacurso provider, as well as the predefined AI actions in Moodle.

![History](./_docs/images/aiprovider_datacurso_5_page-report-history.png)

### Reports grafics

The second section displays information about credit usage through visual graphs.
