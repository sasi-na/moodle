## [2.1.3] - 2026-09-08

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible from **Moodle 5.0** to **Moodle 5.2**.

### Security
- **Upstream error responses are no longer shown to end users**
  When the AI service failed (HTTP error or transport failure), the processors returned the raw upstream body or the transport message as `errormessage`, which Moodle core displays in the editor and persists in `ai_action_register`. They now return the localized `httperror` / `serviceunavailable` messages; the raw detail is only written to developer debugging output.
- **Hardened image download fallback**
  When the AI service returns an image URL instead of inline base64, the plugin now only fetches it over `https`, from the same host as the AI service endpoint, with an allowed image extension (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `webp`), without following redirects, within 30 seconds and up to 10 MiB (declared length and streamed length). The downloaded bytes, like inline base64 images, must sniff as PNG, JPEG or WEBP before being stored, and the stored name is always `datacurso_image_<timestamp>.<ext>`. Contract note: images hosted on a third-party CDN are rejected by design; the service must return `b64_json` (already the preferred format). The public `download_file()` method of the image processor was removed and the request body (including the prompt) is no longer written to debugging output.
- **Shop client, API client and user lookup no longer leak internals**
  The shop API client raises localized exceptions (`instance_disabled`, `licensekey_missing`, `curlerror`, `httperror`, `jsondecodeerror`) carrying only the cURL error number or the HTTP status, never the request URL or the response body; the base API client stops writing response bodies to debugging output; and the `get_users` web service returns a localized message instead of the database error text.
- **AI service endpoint resolved once per request**
  The processors resolve the AI service endpoint (which performs a license check against the shop) a single time per request instead of two or three times, and a failure while pinning the image host now degrades to the localized invalid-image error instead of raising an exception after a successful AI response.
- **Base API client no longer exposes cURL error text**
  `datacurso_api_base` reports transport failures with the cURL error number only; the raw libcurl message (which may contain hostnames) is confined to developer debugging output.
- **Removed a request-payload debug log**
  `datacurso_api_base` no longer writes the outgoing request payload (`PAYLOAD: ...`) to debugging output on every 4xx/5xx response; only the response size and status are logged.
- **Pixel-area cap on generated images**
  Generated images are rejected when their declared dimensions exceed 25 megapixels, so a small file cannot expand into a huge bitmap on decode.
- **Actionable 403 messages in the processors**
  Credit exhaustion (`tokens_not_sufficient`) and license rejections (`license_not_allowed`) from the AI service now surface the same localized, actionable messages used by the other Datacurso plugins instead of the generic HTTP 403 error.
- **Course service rate-limit headers declared**
  The privacy metadata for the course creation service now declares the rate-limit headers that are forwarded when the `local_coursegen` limit is enabled.
- **Complete privacy metadata**
  The privacy metadata now declares the three external Datacurso systems separately (`datacurso_ai_services`, `datacurso_course_service`, `datacurso_shop`) with every field actually transferred (messages, model, image size and count, site identifier and URL, timezone, language, uploaded files, license key header and rate-limit headers), declares the `externalid` column of the local consumption table, and the privacy statement no longer claims that no personal data is stored locally. The future remote erasure/export hook is documented in the privacy provider; it is not implemented because the services expose no privacy endpoints yet, so remote erasure requests are handled through Datacurso support.

### Changed
- **Privacy metadata language strings restructured**
  Strings for the single generic external location (`privacy:metadata:aiprovider_datacurso:*`) were removed in every language; `privacy:metadata:aiprovider_datacurso` is kept as the export root label. The dead rate-limit and per-user quota strings (`privacy:metadata:aiprovider_datacurso_rlimit*` and `privacy:metadata:aiprovider_datacurso_userlimit*`, left over from tables removed in earlier releases) were also removed in every language.
- **Testable transport in the HTTP clients**
  `datacurso_api` and `datacurso_api_base` build their cURL wrapper through a `create_curl()` substitution point, and `user_service::get_users()` accepts an optional database instance, so error handling is covered by automated tests without network access.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-09-04

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible from **Moodle 5.0** to **Moodle 5.2**.

### Added
- **Jenkins CI onboarding**: new `Jenkinsfile.moodleplugin` pins `moodlePluginCI` to
  `MOODLE_500_STABLE`, so the plugin can run through the shared Jenkins pipeline in addition to
  GitHub Actions.
- **Expanded automated test coverage**: the sync contract (duplicate external id rejection, the
  `/tokens/historial-consumos` request shape, and empty/garbage date parsing), the consumption
  history report's active columns, action/service id-to-name resolution (with unknown ids passing
  through verbatim), and privacy export with seeded data.

### Fixed
- **Admin-configured system instruction is now honored**: `generate_text` and `summarise_text`
  requests previously ignored the instance form's system instruction and always sent the
  hardcoded per-action default; the resolved value is now used.
- **Privacy export no longer drops rows**: exporting a user's consumption history returned only
  the last database row instead of the full history.
- **POST payloads no longer escape non-ASCII characters**: accented and multibyte text now
  reaches the API as raw UTF-8 instead of `\uXXXX` sequences.
- **Rate-limit form defaults corrected**: the instance form's credit-budget default was wired to
  the window-length field instead of the limit field, and the window unit had no default at all.
- **Connection failures are handled gracefully**: network-level errors (DNS, timeout, refused) now
  return the same graceful error response as an API-level failure, instead of an uncaught
  exception.
- **Removed a dead per-request debug log file** written to moodledata on every POST call with no
  rotation.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-09-01

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible from **Moodle 5.0** to **Moodle 5.2**.

### Added
- **Local consumption mirror table and Report Builder integration**
  A new `aiprovider_datacurso_consumption` table locally mirrors the external Datacurso credit
  consumption history (`externalid`, `userid`, `service`, `action`, `credits`, `balance`,
  `timecreated`). `consumption_sync` keeps it up to date on demand (page-load-driven, lock-guarded,
  watermarked on `MAX(externalid)`); the consumption history tab now renders it through a Report
  Builder system report (`consumption_history`), which provides filtering, sorting, pagination and
  download (CSV/Excel/ODS) for free.
- **`aiprovider_datacurso_get_consumption_summary` web service**
  New AJAX-callable external function returning server-side aggregated credit totals (grouped by
  month, day, action or service) for the general report charts, backed by
  `consumption_service::get_summary()` reading from the local mirror table.
- **Privacy metadata for the consumption mirror table**
  `classes/privacy/provider.php` now declares `aiprovider_datacurso_consumption` and maps it to
  the owning user, so it participates in data export/deletion requests.

### Changed
- **Consumption report download now honors active filters and columns**
  Downloading the consumption history now goes through Report Builder, so the exported file
  reflects whatever filters, sorting and visible columns are currently applied — replacing the
  previous single "export full history" CSV button, which always ignored active filters.
- **General report charts read from the local mirror, not the external API**
  `report_charts.js` now fetches pre-aggregated totals from
  `aiprovider_datacurso_get_consumption_summary` instead of downloading and grouping raw
  consumption rows client-side, reducing payload size and client-side processing.

### Removed
- **Legacy consumption history table UI**: `amd/src/consumption.js`, the
  `get_consumption_history` external function and its backing service, the
  `output/consumption_page` renderable, and the `consumption_page`/`consumption_row` Mustache
  templates — all superseded by the Report Builder system report above.
- **`get_all_consumption` external function**: superseded by the aggregated
  `get_consumption_summary` endpoint; the report charts no longer need the full raw history.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-26

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible from **Moodle 5.0** to **Moodle 5.2**.

### Added
- **Per-action credit fields on the provider-instance form**
  The provider-instance configuration form now exposes a credits-per-action field
  (`ratelimit_{service}_credit_{action}`) for every action of every service, next to the
  existing enable/limit/window fields, replacing the abandoned global credit-per-action setting.
  Each field carries a client-side positive-integer validation rule, matching the 4.5 form's
  check (there is no server-side `validation()` seam on the core provider-instance form).
- **`execute_request()` test seam in the HTTP client**
  `datacurso_api_base::send_request()` now delegates the actual cURL dispatch to a protected
  `execute_request()` method, so tests can capture the outgoing request (including rate-limit
  headers) without a network call.

### Changed
- **Rate limiting moved from local enforcement to forwarded headers**
  The plugin no longer tracks per-user, per-service usage in local tables. It computes
  `X-RateLimit-*` headers from the provider-instance configuration and forwards them; the
  remote Datacurso token-manager accumulates consumption and enforces the limit centrally.
- **`ratelimiter` requires its owning provider instance**
  `new ratelimiter($instanceprovider)` is now mandatory (no default); all rate-limit reads come
  from `$instanceprovider->config`, never from global plugin config.
- **`provider::get_credit_for_action()` is now instance-aware**
  Changed from a static method reading a dead global config key to a public instance method
  reading `$this->config["ratelimit_{service}_credit_{action}"]`, with the existing
  catalogue-default fallback chain.
- **`upload_file()` takes a `\stored_file` again**
  Callers hold Moodle file storage objects, not filesystem paths; the temporary file needed by
  cURL is created and removed internally. The richer 403 detail handling (`rate_limit_exceeded`,
  `tokens_not_sufficient`, `license_not_allowed`) is restored.
- **Reports tab structure keeps the 5.0 provider-instance layout**
  `consumption`, `generalreport`, `pluginslist` and the "Provider configuration" link (pointing
  at the core AI provider-instance edit form) are unchanged; the CSV export and year filter are
  now available on the consumption and general report tabs.
- **Reports access capability widened to the manager archetype**
  The consumption/report page and its primary-navigation entry now gate on
  `aiprovider/datacurso:viewreports` instead of `moodle/site:config`, so any user with the
  manager role (not only admins) can reach AI usage reports.

### Removed
- **Webservice self-configuration**: the admin page, the `aiprovider/datacurso:configurews`
  capability, and the backend class that generated and managed a dedicated Moodle webservice
  token for the plugin.
- **Per-user AI credit token limits**: the `aiprovider_datacurso_userlimit` table, its admin
  page, and the associated external functions.
- **Per-service, per-action user allowlists**: `local_assign_ai`, `local_coursegen`,
  `local_datacurso_ratings`, `ratelimit_settings` and `report_lifestory` rate-limit classes, and
  their configuration fields and language strings.
- **Local per-window rate-limit usage tracking**: the `aiprovider_datacurso_rlimit` table and
  the DB-backed precheck/sync methods that read and wrote it.
- **Global admin license key and rate-limit settings**: removed from `settings.php`; both now
  live exclusively on the provider-instance configuration form.

### Fixed
- **Upgrade checkpoint `2025112706` no longer calls a removed class**
  The body called `webservice_config::upgrade_sync_ws_and_capabilities()` inside a try/catch
  that only caught `\Exception`, so a missing class raised an uncatchable `\Error` and aborted
  the upgrade. The savepoint number is retained; the body is now a no-op.
- **Upgrade step `2026082600` sweeps dead per-instance allowlist keys**
  The 4.5-line global config cleanup (`unset_config()`) could not reach per-instance settings,
  which live as JSON in `ai_providers.config`. This step strips the leftover
  `ratelimit_*_allowedusers*` / `*_coursecreators` / `*_activitycreators` / `*_courseanalysts` /
  `*_generalanalysts` keys from every Datacurso provider instance's stored configuration.
- **`ratelimiter` constructor arity mismatch**
  Merging the header-forwarding rate-limit model against the 5.0 instance-scoped constructor
  left two call sites passing zero arguments to a constructor that requires one
  (`ArgumentCountError`); both now pass the owning provider instance.

## 2.0.5

**Released on:** 2026-02-10

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **from Moodle 5.0 to Moodle 5.1**.

## Fixed
- **Fatal error when only course generation allowlist was considered**  
  Corrected the rate limit user check that previously only evaluated the
  `local_coursegen` course creator list, which could cause incorrect
  access validation or fatal errors when other services or actions were
  configured.

## Added
- **Service/action-specific allowlist handling**  
  Extended the rate limiter so each AI-enabled service can declare its own
  user allowlist per HTTP action path (for example, `/course/v2/start` vs
  `/resources/create-mod`), keeping the access rules for different actions
  completely independent.

## Changed
- **Centralised helpers and internal clean-up**  
  Introduced small internal helpers to map paths to configuration keys and
  to extract user ids from configuration, reducing duplication and making
  future changes easier to maintain.
- **Version bump**  
  Release version bumped to **2.0.5**.

## 2.0.4

**Released on:** 2026-01-29

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **from Moodle 5.0 to Moodle 5.1**.

## Fixed
- **Suppress developer debug warning when listing rate-limited users**  
  Updated the rate-limit user selector query to load all required name fields (`firstnamephonetic`, `lastnamephonetic`, `middlename`, `alternatename`) so that `fullname()` no longer triggers the developer `debugging()` warning when building the allowed users lists.


## 2.0.3

**Released on:** 2026-01-26

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **from Moodle 5.0 to Moodle 5.1**.

## Added
- **Configurable base URLs for DataCurso AI services**  
  Added support for configurable base URLs for both the **standard** and **EU-hosted** DataCurso AI services, allowing greater flexibility across environments.
- **Optional base URL parameters in constructors**  
  Updated service constructors to accept optional base URL parameters, enabling explicit overrides when needed.
- **CHANGE.md file for change history**  
  Added a new **CHANGE.md** file to maintain a clear, versioned history of changes and releases.


## Changed
- **Centralized base URL resolution via instance method**  
  Refactored base URL access to ensure the correct instance method is used when resolving the active base URL, improving consistency and maintainability.
- **Service initialization flow updated**  
  Adjusted internal initialization logic so all API requests correctly respect the configured base URL (standard or EU-hosted).
- **Version bump**  
  Release version bumped to **2.0.3**.


## 2.0.2

**Released on:** 2026-01-19

## Added

- **Enhanced webservice setup error logging.**  
Improved error reporting during webservice registration by including the original exception message, providing clearer diagnostics when the setup process fails.

## Changed

- **Improved boolean evaluation logic.**  
Adjusted the `is_for_ue` method to ensure proper and safe boolean comparison, preventing unintended conditional behavior.

## Fixed

- **Webservice setup debugging limitations.**  
Resolved an issue where webservice registration failures did not expose sufficient context, making troubleshooting difficult.

## Changed

- **Release bump to 2.0.2**  
Updated the plugin version and release metadata to **2.0.2** to reflect the included improvements and fixes.

## 2.0.1

**Released on:** 2025-12-15

Updated the plugin release number to **2.0.1**.

---

_History below this point predates the 5.0 provider-instance / 4.5 rate-limiting port (2.1.0). It
is the 4.5 line's own changelog, preserved verbatim for audit purposes; its version numbers
(1.x.x) are a separate, now-retired numbering scheme._

## [1.4.3] - 2026-08-14

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible only with **Moodle 4.5**.

### Changed
- **Course creator API endpoint**
  The course generation service now points to `https://course-ai-v2.datacurso.com/api/v1` for both the standard and EU regions.
- **Default per-window rate limit**
  The rate limit configuration form now prefills the credit limit per service from `provider::get_default_window_limit()` instead of a flat `10` for every service, so each service starts with a sensible default based on its most expensive action.
- **Site URL in outgoing payloads**
  Requests to the Datacurso API now include `site_url` so the service can identify the originating site.

### Fixed
- **Service user cleanup on upgrade**
  The upgrade step that removes artifacts from the deprecated Datacurso webservice setup now also deletes the `datacursows` service account, instead of leaving it for a site administrator to remove manually.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-10

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible only with **Moodle 4.5**.

### Fixed
- **File upload from the Moodle file storage API**
  `upload_file()` declared a string path, but callers hold a `stored_file` and
  Moodle keeps files in the file storage API, so uploading a syllabus threw a
  `TypeError` before any request was made. It now takes the `stored_file`,
  copies its content to a temporary file for the request, and removes that copy
  even when the request fails. No caller changes were needed.

  This behaviour was added in 1.2.x and was lost when `MOODLE_405_STABLE` was
  merged into `dev`: that side was ahead everywhere else in the file, so its
  older `upload_file` was kept along with the rest.

### Added
- **Tests for the upload contract**
  Cover the signature and the behaviour that depends on it: the file argument
  type, the position of the extra parameters, the name and MIME type sent with
  the request, and the removal of the temporary copy on both success and
  failure.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-03

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible only with **Moodle 4.5**.

### Fixed
- **Upgrade no longer fails with "redissessionhandlerproblem"**
  The `2026071601` upgrade step called `delete_user()` on the legacy `datacursows` service account. `delete_user()` ends by calling `\core\session\manager::destroy_user_sessions()`, which makes lazily initialised session handlers such as Redis run `session_set_save_handler()` from within the upgrade; under CLI the output has already been sent at that point, so the handler could not be registered and the upgrade aborted before reaching its savepoint

### Changed
- **The upgrade step no longer removes the service user account**
  Cleanup is now limited to the artifacts the plugin owns (external service, role and registration config flags). The `datacursows` account is left in place for administrators to delete from the users management page

- **Version bump**
  Internal version bumped to **2026080300** and release version bumped to **1.4.2**

## [1.4.1] - 2025-07-25

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible only with **Moodle 4.5**.

### Changed
- **Image/no-image variants for all action identifiers** (PR #14)
  Replaced bare `create_activity_*` entries with `_image`/`_noimage` pairs in `get_actions()` so consumption reports distinguish between image-generating and non-image requests per activity type. Added `/course/execute_image` and `/course/execute_noimage` variants for course creation
- **40 new action entries with translations in all 7 supported languages**
  Added language strings for all image/noimage action variants in en, es, fr, de, id, pt_br, and ru
- **Version bump**
  Internal version bumped to **2026072500** and release version bumped to **1.4.1**

## [1.4.0] - 2025-07-25

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible only with **Moodle 4.5**.

### Added
- **19 Moodle activity type action identifiers** (PR #12)
  Registered `create_activity_*` identifiers in the provider's action catalog so consumption reports show specific activity types (assign, quiz, lesson, workshop, h5pactivity, scorm, feedback, choice, data, book, page, resource, url, folder, label, imscp, forum, glossary, wiki) instead of the generic "Generate activity or resource with AI"
- **Translations for activity type identifiers in all 7 supported languages**
  Added language strings for all 19 activity type action names in en, es, fr, de, id, pt_br, and ru

### Changed
- **Version bump**
  Internal version bumped to **2026072400** and release version bumped to **1.4.0**

### Fixed
- **Removed unnecessary ratelimiter routing for activity type identifiers**
  Cleaned up prefix routing in `ratelimiter.php` that was no longer needed for `create_activity_*` identifiers

## 1.3.0

**Released on:** 2026-07-23

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **with Moodle 4.5 only**.

## Removed
- **Removed the Datacurso webservice setup feature** (PR #11)  
  Deleted the "Datacurso webservice setup" admin page, its `aiprovider/datacurso:configurews` capability, the external service functions (`aiprovider_datacurso_webservice_setup`, `aiprovider_datacurso_webservice_regenerate_token`, `aiprovider_datacurso_webservice_get_status`), the `webservice_config` backend class and its AMD modules, and the related documentation and images.
- **Added an upgrade step to clean up legacy webservice artifacts**  
  On existing sites the upgrade removes the previously created service user, role, external service, token and stored registration config keys left by the old setup.

## 1.1.6

**Released on:** 2026-04-29

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **with Moodle 4.5 only**.

## Changed
- **Optimized admin settings loading path**  
  Added an `ADMIN->fulltree` guard in provider settings so heavy per-service user capability lookups are executed only when the Datacurso settings page is actually rendered.
- **Removed per-user allowlist controls from Datacurso rate limiting**  
  Deleted service-specific allowlist checks and settings so Moodle permissions are the only access control, while preserving existing per-service rate-limit enforcement.
- **Cleaned obsolete allowlist configuration and code paths**  
  Removed allowlist-only classes/strings and added an upgrade step to delete legacy allowlist config keys.

## 1.1.5

**Released on:** 2026-04-29

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **with Moodle 4.5 only**.

## Changed
- **Optimized ratelimit settings class lookup in admin settings**  
  Replaced dynamic class discovery per service with an explicit service-to-class map in the provider, reducing unnecessary autoload checks when loading plugin settings.
- **Added tests for ratelimit settings mapping**  
  Added PHPUnit coverage for known and unknown service ids to ensure class resolution remains predictable and maintainable.

## 1.0.10

**Released on:** 2026-02-10

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **with Moodle 4.5 only**.

## Fixed
- **Abstract ratelimit_settings caused fatal error**  
  Resolved a fatal error triggered when `ratelimit_settings` was treated as
  an abstract class while service-specific rate limit classes no longer
  extended it.

## Changed
- **Relaxed service binding for allowlist resolution**  
  Updated `ratelimit_settings::get_allowed_users_for_service()` to call the
  static `get_allowed_service_user_ids()` method only when it exists on the
  target service class, removing the hard requirement for inheritance and
  keeping services decoupled from the base helper.
- **Version bump**  
  Release version bumped to **1.0.10**.

## 1.0.9

**Released on:** 2026-02-10

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **with Moodle 4.5 only**.

## Fixed
- **Fatal error when only course generation allowlist was considered**  
  Corrected the rate limit user check that previously only evaluated the
  `local_coursegen` course creator list, which could cause incorrect
  access validation or fatal errors when other services or actions were
  configured.

## Added
- **Service/action-specific allowlist handling**  
  Extended the rate limiter so each AI-enabled service can declare its own
  user allowlist per HTTP action path (for example, `/course/v2/start` vs
  `/resources/create-mod`), keeping the access rules for different actions
  completely independent.

## Changed
- **Centralised helpers and internal clean-up**  
  Introduced small internal helpers to map paths to configuration keys and
  to extract user ids from configuration, reducing duplication and making
  future changes easier to maintain.
- **Version bump**  
  Release version bumped to **1.0.9**.

## 1.0.8

**Released on:** 2026-01-29

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **with Moodle 4.5 only**.

## Fixed
- **Suppress developer debug warning when listing rate-limited users**  
  Updated the rate-limit user selector query to load all required name fields (`firstnamephonetic`, `lastnamephonetic`, `middlename`, `alternatename`) so that `fullname()` no longer triggers the developer `debugging()` warning when building the allowed users lists.


## 1.0.7

**Released on:** 2026-01-26

**Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **from Moodle 4.5 to Moodle 5.1**.

## Added
- **Configurable base URLs for DataCurso AI services**  
  Added support for configurable base URLs for both the **standard** and **EU-hosted** DataCurso AI services, allowing greater flexibility across environments.
- **Optional base URL parameters in constructors**  
  Updated service constructors to accept optional base URL parameters, enabling explicit overrides when needed.

## Changed
- **Centralized base URL resolution via instance method**  
  Refactored base URL access to ensure the correct instance method is used when resolving the active base URL, improving consistency and maintainability.
- **Service initialization flow updated**  
  Adjusted internal initialization logic so all API requests correctly respect the configured base URL (standard or EU-hosted).
- **Version bump**  
  Release version bumped to **1.0.7**.


## 1.0.6

Updated the plugin version and release metadata to **1.0.6** to reflect the included improvements and fixes.

## 1.0.5

**Released on:** 2025-12-04

 **Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **only with Moodle 4.5**.

## Fixed
- **Upgrade savepoint order corrected**  
  Reordered the upgrade savepoint to prevent upgrade failures related to the `aiprovider_datacurso_userlimit`

## 1.0.4

**Released on:** 2025-12-02

Fixed
- add missing capabilities and web service functions

## 1.0.3

**Released on:** 2025-12-02

 **Compatibility note:** This version is compatible **only with Moodle 4.5**.

## Added
- **Automated release workflow for the plugin.**  
  A new GitHub Actions workflow was added to streamline/automate Moodle plugin releases.
- **Support only for Moodle 4.5.**  
  Added `$plugin->supported` in `version.php` to declare Moodle 4.5 as the only supported version.

## Changed
- **Release bump to 1.0.3**  
  The plugin release number was updated to **1.0.3**.
